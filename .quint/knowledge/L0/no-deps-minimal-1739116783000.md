# Holon: No-Dependency Minimal Structure

**ID**: no-deps-minimal-1739116783000
**Level**: L0 (Hypothesis)
**Kind**: system
**Decision Context**: project-structure-decision-1739116780000
**Created**: 2025-02-09

## Content

### Method (Recipe)
Extreme minimal structure with zero external tooling dependencies:

```
ironclaw/
├── orchestrator/
│   ├── main.rs             # Single-file CLI (initially)
│   └── vm.rs               # Single-file VM module
├── agent/
│   ├── loop.py             # Single-file reasoning loop
│   └── test_loop.py        # Single-file test
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

**No Build Tools Initially**:
- Rust: Direct `rustc` compilation (no Cargo until needed)
- Python: Direct `python loop.py` (no pyproject.toml until needed)
- Tests: Single `test_*.py` file with asserts (no pytest initially)
- Git: Hand-written `.gitignore` (no pre-commit hooks)

**Add Tooling Only When Pain is Felt**:
- Add Cargo when we have >3 Rust files
- Add pytest when we have >5 tests
- Add pre-commit when team size >2
- Add CI when we have external contributors

**TDD Philosophy**:
- Write test function next to implementation
- Run `python test_loop.py` manually
- Run `rustc --test` manually
- Commit when test passes

## Scope
**Applies to**: Proof-of-concept phase, solo developer, rapid prototyping
**Languages**: Rust (bare minimum), Python 3.11+ (stdlib only)
**Constraints**: Zero external dependencies until proven necessary

## Rationale
```json
{
  "anomaly": "Modern development tools add complexity before it's needed",
  "approach": "Start with absolute minimum, add tools incrementally when pain is felt",
  "alternatives_rejected": [
    "Full CI/CD from day 1 (overengineering for 0 contributors)",
    "Pre-commit hooks for solo dev (adds friction to experimentation)",
    "Complex workspaces for <1000 LOC codebase (premature abstraction)"
  ],
  "confidence_drivers": [
    "Forces understanding of fundamentals (no cargo-culting)",
    "Zero setup time (clone and run)",
    "Tooling learns from project needs, not vice versa",
    "Aligns with 'Agentic Engineering' principle (minimalism)"
  ]
}
```

## Relations
- **MemberOf**: project-structure-decision-1739116780000
- **DependsOn**: []

## Advantages
✅ **Zero Setup**: Clone repository, run code immediately
✅ **Forces Simplicity**: No tooling means code must stay simple
✅ **True Understanding**: Learn why tools are needed before adopting them
✅ **Rapid Prototyping**: No fighting with build configs during exploration
✅ **Philosophically Aligned**: Matches "minimal, auditable" IronClaw principles

## Disadvantages
❌ **Scaling Pain**: Adding Cargo/pyproject.toml later is disruptive
❌ **No Safety Nets**: No pre-commit hooks, no CI, easy to break code
❌ **Manual Testing**: No automated test runner initially
❌ **Team Onboarding**: Future contributors must learn "non-standard" structure
❌ **Reinstrumenting**: Adding tools later feels like "catch-up" work

## Dependencies
None (foundational hypothesis)

## Metadata
- **Author**: FPF Phase 1 (Abduction)
- **Category**: Radical (rejects modern dev tooling orthodoxy)
- **Complexity**: Low (initially), Medium (reinstrumenting later)
- **Risk**: High (technical debt accrues rapidly)
