The enforce ratchet job is failing during the check rust ratchet step. This is what Github Copilot suggests: The job failed because the Rust coverage percentage (55.1%) is below the required ratchet threshold (66.4%) as defined in the workflow. To resolve this:

1. Add tests to increase coverage for your Rust code, especially in orchestrator/ where coverage is measured.
2. Focus on code paths that are currently not being exercised—look for logic, branches, and error handling without test coverage.
3. Once your tests are added, rerun the workflow. When coverage reaches or exceeds 66.4%, the job will pass.

Sample Rust test addition:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_some_function() {
        let result = some_function();
        assert_eq!(result, expected_value);
    }
}
```

For reference, the coverage ratchet logic is enforced in .github/workflows/coverage-ratchet.yml, section “Check Rust ratchet”.
